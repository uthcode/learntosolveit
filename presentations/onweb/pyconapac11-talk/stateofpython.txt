Python
======

Seeing Python as a language reference.

``CPython is only one of the implementation``
``So is PyPy, Jython, IronPython, CLPython``
``And some language implementation that you can write too``


Python Reference Implementation
===============================

* It is called ``CPython``
* Also known as Python, naturally.

CPython Release Schedule
========================

* 3.3   - Under Development at http://hg.python.org/cpython
* 3.2.1 - Mid June, 2011 - Georg Brandl
* 2.7.2 - Mid June, 2011 - Benjamin Peterson
* 3.1.4 - Mid June, 2011 - Benjamin Peterson
* 2.6.7 - 3 - June, 2011 - Barry Warsaw
* Windows Installers by Martin and Mac Installers by Ronald or Ned Deily.

Python3
=======

* Breaking from it's roots.
* Moving away from it's C Background.
* Modern Frameworks and Advanced Applications.
* Taking good points from Java and others.
* Fixing a lot of Language warts.


Python3 Progress
================

* http://py3ksupport.appspot.com/


Framework Supports
==================

* Numpy Supports
* Support not fast in WebFramework world because of the need to sort out WSGI spec.
* Support is steady and moving forward. 
* People use it (and ask questions at various forums)

Jython
======

.. image:: jython.png

* Jython is implementation of the Python programming language written in Java.
* The language syntax and semantics will be same as Python.

Java and Jython
===============

* Import and use any Java class. 
* Except for some standard modules, Jython programs use Java classes instead of Python modules

Why Jython
==========

* You are from the Java world and do not want to feel away from home.
* Dynamic compilation to Java bytecodes.
* Ability to extend existing Java classes in Jython.
* Optional static compilation - Applets, Servlets and beans

Jython's features
=================

* Prototyping (using Java semantics)
* Java investigation of classes.
* Glues together libraries already written in Java.
* Runs on any JVM above 1.1
* Truly multi-threaded (no GIL) and Java garbage collected.

Java Introspection
==================

::

	>>> from java.util import Date
	>>> d = Date()
	>>> print d
	Fri Jun 10 09:08:58 SGT 2011
	>>> import sys
	>>> sys.path

        # [..,'__classpath__', ... ]


Subclassing java
================

::

	from java import awt

	class SpamListener(awt.event.ActionListener):
	    def actionPerformed(self,event):
		if event.getActionCommand() == "Spam":
		    print 'Spam and eggs!'

	f = awt.Frame("Subclassing Example")
	b = awt.Button("Spam")
	b.addActionListener(SpamListener())
	f.add(b, "Center")
	f.pack()
	f.setVisible(1)


How is Jython doing?
====================

* Current Jython is compatible with CPython reference implementation 2.5.2
* Supports Popular Python frameworks such as Django, Pylons, or SQLAlchemy.
* Scripting support in IBM WebLogic and Websphere application server.
* ZK Java Ajax Framework Support.
* virtualenv, easy_install

Jython Platform Support
=======================

* apt-get install jython
* Or Download and java -jar jython-2.5.2.jar
* On All platforms which support Java Standard Edition.
* Not Java Mobile Edition, so not for Android.

Performance
===========

Performance to CPython is comparable to slower in general.
Multi-threaded applications can be faster.

The good news is, it is not just an extension language, but complete programming language suitable for application development.

IronPython
==========

IronPython is an implementation of the Python programming language targeting the .NET Framework and Mono.

Features
========

* IronPython can use the .NET Framework and Python libraries, and other .NET languages can use Python code just as easily.
* Release 2.7 was released on March 12, 2011 and it targets CPython 2.7.

Installation
============

* IronPython 2.7 installer available for Windows Platform, as Desktop and Server Apps.
* Pre-requisite include .NET 4.0 or Silverlight 4.
* Also supports Browser apps development via Silverlight - Browser App for Mac and Windows.
* via Mono - desktop app for Linux and Mac.  
* via Moonlight plugin - as browser app for Linux.


Why should you be interested?
=============================

* Corporate credibility, when company uses .Net technologies.
* No GlobalInterpreterLock - IronPython has no GIL and multi-threaded code can use multi core processors
* The .NET framework library is very big. Windows Forms support.
* Easier to extend than CPython (C# is memory managed and C# types can be used directly in IronPython with no wrapping)
* An extensibility layer to application frameworks written in a .NET language. 
* Silverlight!


Example code
============

::

	import clr
	clr.AddReference("System.Windows.Forms")
	 
	from System.Windows.Forms import MessageBox
	MessageBox.Show("Hello World")


FrameWork Support
=================

* Numpy, and Scipy support via IronClad_
* Django_ on only with lot of hacks


.. _IronClad: http://code.google.com/p/ironclad/
.. _Django: https://bitbucket.org/jdhardy/django-ironpython/wiki/Run_the_Test_Suite

Example Applications
====================

* http://www.silverlight.net/learn/dynamic-languages/#example_applications
* http://ironpython.net/try

Also supported in:

* The Microsoft Robotics Kit
* XNA: 3D and Games Programming Framework

PyPy
====

PyPy is a Python Interpreter written in Python and it is a JIT Compiler. It focusses on Speed, Efficiency and 100% CPython compatibility.


How will you code in PyPy
=========================

* It is just your normal pure python code!
* Just run it against pypy interpreter.

PyPy Architecture

Release
=======

* CPython 2.7.1 compatible. It runs on 32- and 64-bit Intel x86 architecture and includes a JIT compiler.


Framework Compatiblity
======================

* A plenty. Pylons, Pyglet, Nevow and Django.
* Almost anything that does not involve ctypes module.
* Tkinter and IDLE with PyPy
* Numpy integration is in progress.


Performance
===========

Speed,Speed,Speed
=================

* It's all about Speed.

The Future
==========

* It's Python Language!
* Choose the implementation which suits you most
* Work alongside other languages and frameworks.
