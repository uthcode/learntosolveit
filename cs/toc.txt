P vs NP problem

Suppose that you are organizing housing accommodations for a group of four
hundred university students. Space is limited and only one hundred of the
students will receive places in the dormitory. To complicate matters, the Dean
has provided you with a list of pairs of incompatible students, and requested
that no pair from this list appear in your final choice. This is an example of
what computer scientists call an NP-problem, since it is easy to check if a
given choice of one hundred students proposed by a coworker is satisfactory
(i.e., no pair taken from your coworker's list also appears on the list from
the Dean's office), however the task of generating such a list from scratch
seems to be so hard as to be completely impractical. Indeed, the total number
of ways of choosing one hundred students from the four hundred applicants is
greater than the number of atoms in the known universe! Thus no future
civilization could ever hope to build a supercomputer capable of solving the
problem by brute force; that is, by checking every possible combination of 100
students. However, this apparent difficulty may only reflect the lack of
ingenuity of your programmer. In fact, one of the outstanding problems in
computer science is determining whether questions exist whose answer can be
quickly checked, but which require an impossibly long time to solve by any
direct procedure. Problems like the one listed above certainly seem to be of
this kind, but so far no one has managed to prove that any of them really are
so hard as they appear, i.e., that there really is no feasible way to generate
an answer with the help of a computer. Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin formulated
the P (i.e., easy to find) versus NP (i.e., easy to check) problem
independently in 1971. 


A problem is of type P, if it can be solved using an algorithm whose running
time grows no faster than some fixed power of number of symbols required to
specify the initial data.
