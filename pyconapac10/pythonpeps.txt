PEP 3000
========

* GuidoVan Rossum  - 05/April/2006 (*It's June/2010 now. Lot of thought has gone in*)
* Python 3.0 will break the backwards compatiblity with Python 2.x
* Python 2.6+ to support forward compatiblity.
* Implementation Details – Write in C.
* Source code conversion tool (2to3), context free source to source translation.

.. class:: handout

        Python 3000, Python 3.0 and Py3K are all names for the same thing.
        The project is called Python 3000, or abbreviated to Py3k.  The actual
        Python release will same naming convention is used for Python 2.x.

        Guido planned that Python 3.1 and 3.2 to be released much sooner after
        3.0 than it has been customary for the 2.x series.  The 3.x release
        pattern will stabilize once the community is happy with 3.x.

        Actually Python 3.1 shippped with io module written in Python which
        caused significant performance problems. Python Core Devs recommend
        against the use of Python 3.1 for any purpose. Use Python 3.2 which is better.

        Python 3.x will be break the backward compability, but Python 2.6 and Python
        2.7 will support forwarding compatibility in the following ways.

        * It will support a "Py3k warnings mode" which will warn dynamically (i.e. at
          runtime) about features that will stop working in Python 3.0, e.g. assuming
          that range() returns a list.

        * It will contain backported versions of many Py3k features, either enabled
          through __future__ statements or simply by allowing old and new syntax to be
          used side-by-side (if the new syntax would be a syntax error in 2.x).

        * 2to3 source conversion tool is provide.This tool can do a context-free
          source-to-source translation.  For example, it can translate ``apply(f,
          args)`` into ``f(*args)``.  However, the tool cannot do data flow analysis or
          type inferencing, so it simply assumes that ``apply`` in this example refers
          to the old built-in function.

        The recommended development model for a project that needs to support
        Python 2.7 and 3.2 simultaneously is as follows:

        0. You should have excellent unit tests with close to full coverage.
        1. Port your project to Python 2.6.
        2. Turn on the Py3k warnings mode.
        3. Test and edit until no warnings remain.
        4. Use the 2to3 tool to convert this source code to 3.2 syntax.
           **Do not manually edit the output!**
        5. Test the converted source code under 3.2.
        6. If problems are found, make corrections to the **2.6** version
           of the source code and go back to step 3.
        7. When it's time to release, release separate 2.6 and 3.2 tarballs
           (or whatever archive form you use for releases).

        It is recommended not to edit the 3.2 source code until you are ready
        to reduce 2.6 support to pure maintenance (i.e. the moment when you
        would normally move the 2.6 code to a maintenance branch anyway).

PEP 3105
========

* Make print a function
* Good move!
* Rationale for making print as a function.
* Signature of the print function

::

        def print(*args, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None)

* No backwards compatible. All your python 2 code which contains print statement will break.

.. class:: handout
       

        * ``print`` is the only application-level functionality that has a
          statement dedicated to it. Within Python's world, syntax is generally
          used as a last resort, when something *can't* be done without help from
          the compiler. Print doesn't qualify for such an exception.

        * At some point in application development one quite often feels the need
          to replace ``print`` output by something more sophisticated, like
          logging calls or calls into some other I/O library. With a ``print()``
          function, this is a straightforward string replacement, today it is
          a mess adding all those parentheses and possibly converting ``>>stream``
          style syntax.

        * Having special syntax for ``print`` puts up a much larger barrier for
          evolution, e.g. a hypothetical new ``printf()`` function is not too
          far fetched when it will coexist with a ``print()`` function.

        * There's no easy way to convert ``print`` statements into another call
          if one needs a different separator, not spaces, or none at all.
          Also, there's no easy way *at all* to conveniently print objects with
          some other separator than a space.

        * If ``print()`` is a function, it would be much easier to replace it within
          one module (just ``def print(*args):...``) or even throughout a program
          (e.g. by putting a different function in ``__builtin__.print``). As it is,
          one can do this by writing a class with a ``write()`` method and
          assigning that to ``sys.stdout`` -- that's not bad, but definitely a much
          larger conceptual leap, and it works at a different level than print.

        Luckily, as it is a statement in Python 2, ``print`` can be detected
        and replaced reliably and non-ambiguously by an automated tool, so
        there should be no major porting problems.


PEP 3106
========

* Guido – Changes to dict.keys(), .values() and .items()
* It returns a set like unordered container objects whose contents are derived from underlying dictionary rather than a list which is a copy of keys etc. 
* Remove iterkeys, itervalues and iteritems method.
* Inspired by the Java Collections Framework.


.. class:: handout

        Revamping dict.keys(), .values() and .items()


        This PEP proposes to change the .keys(), .values() and .items()
        methods of the built-in dict type to return a set-like or unordered
        container object whose contents are derived from the underlying
        dictionary rather than a list which is a copy of the keys, etc.; and
        to remove the .iterkeys(), .itervalues() and .iteritems() methods.

        The approach is inspired by that taken in the Java Collections
        Framework.

        The objects returned by the .keys() and .items() methods behave like
        sets.  The object returned by the values() method behaves like a much
        simpler unordered collection -- it cannot be a set because duplicate
        values are possible.

        Because of the set behavior, it will be possible to check whether two
        dicts have the same keys by simply testing::

            if a.keys() == b.keys(): ...

        and similarly for .items().


PEP 3108

PEP 3109
========

* Changes to Python's Exception Raise mechanism.
* Intended to reduce Line Noise as well as size of the language.
* Consolidation of several raise forms – raise X,Y and raise X(Y) which are equivalent in py2.
* Changes to raise exception syntax and throw method in generator object.
* To hold exception object raise E as e

.. class:: handout

        One of Python's guiding maxims is "there should be one -- and
        preferably only one -- obvious way to do it". Python 2.x's
        ``raise`` statement violates this principle, permitting multiple
        ways of expressing the same thought. For example, these statements
        are equivalent:

            raise E, V

            raise E(V)

        There is a third form of the ``raise`` statement, allowing arbitrary
        tracebacks to be attached to an exception ::

            raise E, V, T

        where T is a traceback. As specified in PEP 344,
        exception objects in Python 3.x will possess a ``__traceback__``
        attribute, admitting this translation of the three-expression
        ``raise`` statement: ::

            raise E, V, T

        is translated to ::

            e = E(V)
            e.__traceback__ = T
            raise e

        Using these translations, we can reduce the ``raise`` statement from
        four forms to two:

        1. ``raise`` (with no arguments) is used to re-raise the active
           exception in an ``except`` suite.

        2. ``raise EXCEPTION`` is used to raise a new exception. This form has
           two sub-variants: ``EXCEPTION`` may be an exception class or an
           instance of an exception class; valid exception classes are
           BaseException and its subclasses. If ``EXCEPTION``
           is a subclass, it will be called with no arguments to obtain
           an exception instance.

           To raise anything else is an error.


PEP 3110

* Changes to catching Exceptions.

        except E, N:
        except E as n:

* Open issues – Replacing or Dropping sys.exc_info()
* http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-March/062449.html

PEP 3111
========

* Simple input builtin for python
* No longer input() and raw_input()
* Its just one, which is raw_input() renamed to just the input()


.. class:: handout

        Specification

        The existing ``raw_input()`` function will be renamed to ``input()``.

        The Python 2 to 3 conversion tool will replace calls to ``input()`` with
        ``eval(input())`` and ``raw_input()`` with ``input()``.


        BDFL Thoughts on this issue:

        http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-December/005249.html

        I like the exact proposal made here better than any of the alternatives
        mentioned so far.

        Against naming it readline(): the "real" readline doesn't strip the \n
        and returns an empty string for EOF instead of raising EOFError; I
        believe the latter is more helpful for true beginners' code.

        Against naming it ask() and renaming print() to say(): I find those
        rather silly names that belong in toy or AI languages. Changing print
        from statement to function maintains Pythonicity; renaming it say()
        does not.

        I don't expect there will be much potential confusion with the 2.x
        input(); that function is used extremely rarely. It will be trivial to
        add rules to the refactoring tool (sandbox/2to3/) that replace input()
        with eval(input()) and replace raw_input() with input().

        Guido


PEP 3112
========

* Literal syntax for bytes object  - b'bytes'
* Convenient way to spell ascii strings and arbitrary binary data.

.. class:: handout

        Existing spellings of an ASCII string in Python 3000 include::

            bytes('Hello world', 'ascii')
            'Hello world'.encode('ascii')

        The proposed syntax is::

            b'Hello world'

        Existing spellings of an 8-bit binary sequence in Python 3000 include::

            bytes([0x7f, 0x45, 0x4c, 0x46, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x00])
            bytes('\x7fELF\x01\x01\x01\0', 'latin-1')
            '7f454c4601010100'.decode('hex')

        The proposed syntax is::

            b'\x7f\x45\x4c\x46\x01\x01\x01\x00'
            b'\x7fELF\x01\x01\x01\0'


        In both cases, the advantages of the new syntax are brevity, some
        small efficiency gain, and the detection of encoding errors at compile
        time rather than at runtime.  The brevity benefit is especially felt
        when using the string-like methods of bytes objects::

            lines = bdata.split(bytes('\n', 'ascii'))  # existing syntax
            lines = bdata.split(b'\n')  # proposed syntax

        And when converting code from Python 2.x to Python 3000::

            sok.send('EXIT\r\n')  # Python 2.x
            sok.send('EXIT\r\n'.encode('ascii'))  # Python 3000 existing
            sok.send(b'EXIT\r\n')  # proposed

PEP 3113
========

* Removal of tuple parameter unpacking.

::

        def fxn(a, (b, c), d):      pass

* Remove the ablity to pass a container to be received as tuple. More harmful than useful.
* Introspection issues. Un informative error messages, little use-cases.


.. class:: handout

        Tuple parameter unpacking is the use of a tuple as a parameter in a
        function signature so as to have a sequence argument automatically
        unpacked.  An example is::

          def fxn(a, (b, c), d):
              pass

        The use of ``(b, c)`` in the signature requires that the second
        argument to the function be a sequence of length two (e.g.,
        ``[42, -13]``).  When such a sequence is passed it is unpacked and
        has its values assigned to the parameters, just as if the statement
        ``b, c = [42, -13]`` had been executed in the parameter.

        Unfortunately this feature of Python's rich function signature
        abilities, while handy in some situations, causes more issues than
        they are worth.  Thus this PEP proposes their removal from the
        language in Python 3.0.

        The 2to3 refactoring tool 2to3 will gain a fixer
        fixer for translating tuple parameters to being a single parameter
        that is unpacked as the first statement in the function.  The name of
        the new parameter will be changed.  The new parameter will then be
        unpacked into the names originally used in the tuple parameter.  This
        means that the following function

         def fxn((a, (b, c))):
             pass

        will be translated into::

         def fxn(a_b_c):
             (a, (b, c)) = a_b_c
             pass

        As tuple parameters are used by lambdas because of the single
        expression limitation, they must also be supported.  This is done by
        having the expected sequence argument bound to a single parameter and
        then indexing on that parameter::

         lambda (x, y): x + y

        will be translated into::

         lambda x_y: x_y[0] + x_y[1]


PEP 3114
========

* Renaming iterator.next() to iterator.__next__()
* In python 2.x, next() is a protocol, not a method. 
* Its for consistency sake with other implicitly called methods. 

::

        next(x) → x.__next__()

* iter(function, sentinel) <--> next(iterator, sentinel)


.. class:: handout


        Following this pattern, the natural way to handle ``next`` is to add a
        ``next`` built-in function that behaves in exactly the same fashion.

        *   ``next(x)`` --> internal ``tp_iternext`` --> ``x.__next__()``

        Further, it is proposed that the ``next`` built-in function accept a
        sentinel value as an optional second argument, following the style of
        the ``getattr`` and ``iter`` built-in functions.  When called with two
        arguments, ``next`` catches the StopIteration exception and returns
        the sentinel value instead of propagating the exception.  This creates
        a nice duality between ``iter`` and ``next``:

            iter(function, sentinel) <--> next(iterator, sentinel)

        There have been a few objections to the addition of more built-ins.
        In particular, Martin von Loewis writes:

        I dislike the introduction of more builtins unless they have a true
        generality (i.e. are likely to be needed in many programs). For this
        one, I think the normal usage of __next__ will be with a for loop, so
        I don't think one would often need an explicit next() invocation.

        It is also not true that most protocols are explicitly invoked through
        builtin functions. Instead, most protocols are can be explicitly invoked
        through methods in the operator module. So following tradition, it
        should be operator.next.

        ...

        As an alternative, I propose that object grows a .next() method,
        which calls __next__ by default.


        Implementation and Transformation

        Method definitions named ``next`` will be renamed to ``__next__``.

        Explicit calls to the ``next`` method will be replaced with calls to
        the built-in ``next`` function.  For example, ``x.next()`` will become
        ``next(x)``.

.. class:: handout

        Python allows for a variety of stream-like (a.k.a. file-like) objects
        that can be used via ``read()`` and ``write()`` calls.  Anything that
        provides ``read()`` and ``write()`` is stream-like.  However, more
        exotic and extremely useful functions like ``readline()`` or
        ``seek()`` may or may not be available on every stream-like object.
        Python needs a specification for basic byte-based I/O streams to which
        we can add buffering and text-handling features.

        Once we have a defined raw byte-based I/O interface, we can add
        buffering and text handling layers on top of any byte-based I/O class.
        The same buffering and text handling logic can be used for files,
        sockets, byte arrays, or custom I/O classes developed by Python
        programmers.  Developing a standard definition of a stream lets us
        separate stream-based operations like ``read()`` and ``write()`` from
        implementation specific operations like ``fileno()`` and ``isatty()``.
        It encourages programmers to write code that uses streams as streams
        and not require that all streams support file-specific or
        socket-specific operations.

        The new I/O spec is intended to be similar to the Java I/O libraries,
        but generally less confusing.  Programmers who don't want to muck
        about in the new I/O world can expect that the ``open()`` factory
        method will produce an object backwards-compatible with old-style file
        objects.


PEP 3118
========

* Revising the buffer protocol.
* Improving the ways Python allows memory sharing in Python 3.
* Work in progress.

PEP 3119
========

* Guido – Introduction of Abstract Base Classes (ABC).
* Way to overload isinstance and issubclass.
* A new module abc which is to support the Abstract Base Class framework.
* Specific ABCs for Containers and Iterators to be added to collections module.
* What makes a set, mapping, sequence?
* Companion PEP 3141 for numeric types.

PEP 3120
========

* Using UTF-8 as the default source Encoding.
* Martin von Löwis
* Default Source Encoding of Python scripts from ASCII to UTF-8.
* IDLE Changed to use UTF-8 as default encoding.

PEP 3128
========

* Introduction of Class Decorators.
* Collin Winters
* Its an extension of function and method decorators.
* To make certain constructs more easily expressed and less reliant on Cpython Interpretor implementation.
* Its simpler than using metaclasses for class to acheive the same purpose.

PEP 3132
========

* Extended Iterable unpacking

::

        >>>a, *b, c = range(5)
        >>>a
        0
        >>>c
        4
        >>>b
        [1, 2, 3]

PEP 3135
========

* New super
* Syntactic Suger for the super.
* super().foo(1, 2) instead of super(Foo, self).foo(1, 2)

PEP 3137
========

* Guido – Immutable bytes and Mutable buffer
* bytes is a immutable array of bytes.
* bytearray is a mutable array of bytes.
* memoryview is a bytes view of another object.

PEP 3138
========

* String representation in Py3k.

::

        use repr()
        `backticks` gone – its same as repr()
        Repr is Unicode based and not ASCII based in py3

2to3 Tool
=========

* Context sensitive source code to source code translator.
* Useful to convert the py2 source to py3.
* Use it.
* Look or str, bytes issues after the translation. Fix those and fix the interfaces (phew!).
* You are done.

PEP 3099
========

* Greog Brandl – April-2006- Things which will not change in Python 3000.
* BDFL pronoucements on things which will not happen.
* Things such as 'self' will not become implicit.
* Parser wont be more complex than LL
* No braces, no more backticks
* The interpreter prompt will not change. It gives Guido warm fuzzy feelings..

PEP 3003
========

* Python language Moratorium.
* Other Python Implementations to Catch up.
* Changes put into Python be used by large user-base.
* Does not allow for Exceptions to changes in the syntax and semantics of the language.
* Defines what can change and what cannot change.

That's all folks
================

Thank you.
