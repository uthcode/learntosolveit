[https://learntosolveit.com](https://learntosolveit.com) is a website to learn C programming using K&R book. It uses modern tools, and is designed to be used along with the book.

To practice the exercises, you can use the online compilers like

I recommend [https://exercism.org](https://exercism.org) as the platform to
learn programming, including C, and practice with a community of intrinsically
motivated developers.
