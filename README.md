[https://learntosolveit.com](https://learntosolveit.com) is a website to learn C programming using K&R book. It uses modern tools, and is designed to be used along with the book.

To practice the exercises, you can use the online compilers like

learn programming, including C, and practice with a community of intrinsically
motivated developers.
