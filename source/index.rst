Tools to Learn, Understand and Solve Problems
=============================================

The idea behind learn to solve it  website is to present content that will help you to learn programming languages,
technical content and tools that that will help you learn the subject that you wish to learn.

This has mostly computer science technical content as of now. It has example snippets from programming languages to
play with, has solutions to interesting problems presented books that can be helpful to understand the concepts. It
has explainations for difficult algorithms, has common interview problems.

It has notes from various massive online courses in the web. It has notes for Georgia tech's OMSCS program. It has
notes from various papers. It is a repository for the content that Senthil wrote mosty for himself and for others.

The general idea is to explore, play with concepts as we learn something new.

There are countless websites like this in the web. Those will be referenced here.
