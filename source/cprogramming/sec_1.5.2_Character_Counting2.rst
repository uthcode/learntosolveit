Explanation

In this program we are going to count the number of characters present in the
input. The program does the counting by setting nc to 0 in the beginning. As the
program enters for loop condition (nc = 0; getchar() != EOF; ++nc).  When nc
hits end of the document it prints the number of characters in the file.
