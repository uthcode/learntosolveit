/**
 * Exercise 2.1
 *
 * Write a program to print maximum, minimum limits of char, int, long using
 * calculation.
 *
 */

/**
 * Preliminary Information:
 *
 * ~0 will give bits in 1s.
 * >> 1 right shift by 1 bit to remove the sign bit.
 * -1 is added to the maximum limit to get the minimum limit.
 *
 * The maximum and minimum limits of various integer types can be calculated
 * using the following logic:
 *
 * 1. The maximum limit of a signed integer type can be calculated by
 *   (unsigned <type>) ~0 >> 1
 *
 * 2. The minimum limit of a signed integer type can be calculated by
 *  ((unsigned <type>) ~0 >> 1) - 1
 *   *
 * 3. We cast it back to the required type with sign to print the value.
