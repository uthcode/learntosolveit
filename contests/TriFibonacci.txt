Problem Statement
    
A TriFibonacci sequence begins by defining the first three elements A[0], A[1]
and A[2]. The remaining elements are calculated using the following recurrence: 

A[i] = A[i-1] + A[i-2] + A[i-3]

You are given a vector <int> A which contains exactly one element that is equal
to -1, you must replace this element with a positive number in a way that the
sequence becomes a TriFibonacci sequence. Return this number. If no such
positive number exists, return -1.

Definition
      
  Class: TriFibonacci
  Method: complete
  Parameters: vector <int>
  Returns: int
  Method signature: int complete(vector <int> A)

	(be sure your method is public)

Notes
- The constraints for the elements of the input vector <int> A do not
  necessarily apply for the replacement to the missing element.  Constraints

- A will contain between 4 and 20 elements, inclusive.

- Each element of A will be -1 or between 1 and 1000000, inclusive.

- Exactly one element of A will be -1.


Examples

0)
{1,2,3,-1}

Returns: 6

1)
    
{10, 20, 30, 60, -1 , 200}
Returns: 110

2)
    
{1, 2, 3, 5, -1}
Returns: -1

No replacement can make this sequence TriFibonacci as 5 is not equal to 1+2+3.

3)

{1, 1, -1, 2, 3}
Returns: -1
The missing element must be 0 for this sequence to be TriFibonacci. Since this is not a positive integer, return -1.
4)
    
{-1, 7, 8, 1000000}
Returns: 999985
