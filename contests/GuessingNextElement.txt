PROBLEM STATEMENT

An integer arithmetic progression is a sequence defined by two positive integers, p and q, where p is the first element in the sequence, and all other elements are obtained by adding q to the previous element.  For example, if p = 1 and q = 2, the sequence would be: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...



An integer geometric progression is a sequence defined by two positive integers, p and q, where p is the first element in the sequence, and all other elements are obtained by multiplying the previous element by q.  For example, if p = 3 and q = 2, the sequence would be: 3, 6, 12, ...



You are given a vector <int> A, which contains either an integer arithmetic or geometric progression. Determine which one it is and return the next element in the sequence. It is guaranteed that A will uniquely represent either an arithmetic or geometric progression and that result will fit in a 32-bit signed integer.



DEFINITION
Class:GuessingNextElement
Method:guess
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int guess(vector <int> A)


CONSTRAINTS

EXAMPLES

0)
{364,843,1322,1801}

Returns: 2280

This sequence represents an arithmetic progression where p = 364 and q = 479. The next element is 1801 + 479 = 2280.

1)
{394,1172,1950,2728,3506,4284,5062,5840}

Returns: 6618

2)
{13,117,1053,9477,85293}

Returns: 767637

This sequence represents a geometric progression where p = 13 and q = 9. The next element is 85293 * 9 = 76737.


3)
{22,220,2200,22000}

Returns: 220000

4)
{250000, 500000, 1000000}

Returns: 2000000
