PROBLEM STATEMENT
Little Teddy and Little Tracy are now learning how to speak words. Their mother, of course, doesn't want them to speak bad words. According to her definition, a word W is bad if at least one of the following conditions hold  (see the notes section for definitions):

W contains the string badPrefix as a prefix.
W contains the string badSuffix as a suffix.
W contains the string badSubstring as a contiguous substring that is neither a prefix nor a suffix of W.


You are given a vector <string> vocabulary representing the words that Teddy and Tracy are going to learn. Return the number of bad words in vocabulary.

DEFINITION
Class:BadVocabulary
Method:count
Parameters:string, string, string, vector <string>
Returns:int
Method signature:int count(string badPrefix, string badSuffix, string badSubstring, vector <string> vocabulary)


NOTES
-A prefix of a string is obtained by removing zero or more contiguous characters from the end of the string.
-A suffix of a string is obtained by removing zero or more contiguous characters from the beginning of the string.


CONSTRAINTS
-badPrefix, badSuffix, and badSubstring will each contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-vocabulary will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element vocabulary will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each character of badPrefix, badSuffix, and badSubstring will be between 'a' and 'z', inclusive.
-Each character in vocabulary will be between 'a' and 'z', inclusive.
-All elements of vocabulary will be distinct.


EXAMPLES

0)
"bug"
"bug"
"bug"
{"buggy", "debugger", "debug"}

Returns: 3



1)
"a"
"b"
"c"
{"a", "b", "tco"}

Returns: 3

"a" is a prefix of "a". "b" is a suffix of "b". "c" is a substring of "tco". So, all words in vocabulary are bad.

2)
"cut"
"sore"
"scar"
{"scary", "oscar"}

Returns: 0

Although "scar" is a substring of "scary", it is also a prefix. Thus, "scary" is not a bad word. Similarly, as "scar" is a suffix of "oscar", "oscar" is not a bad word.

3)
"bar"
"else"
"foo"
{"foofoofoo", "foobar", "elsewhere"}

Returns: 1

Only the word "foofoofoo" is bad.

4)
"pre"
"s"
"all"
{"all", "coders", "be", "prepared", "for", "the", "challenge", "phase"}

Returns: 3
