1. Declarations and Initializations

1.1 How do you decide which integer type to use? 

1.4 What should the 64-bit type on new, 64-bit machines be? 

1.7 What's the best way to declare and define global variables? 

1.11 What does extern mean in a function declaration? 

1.12 What's the auto keyword good for? 

1.14 I can't seem to define a linked list node which contains a

pointer to itself. 

1.21 How do I declare an array of N pointers to functions returning

pointers to functions returning pointers to characters? 

1.22 How can I declare a function that returns a pointer to a function

of its own type? 

1.25 My compiler is complaining about an invalid redeclaration of a

function, but I only define it once and call it once. 

1.30 What can I safely assume about the initial values of variables

which are not explicitly initialized? 

1.31 Why can't I initialize a local array with a string? 

1.32 What is the difference between char a[] = "string"; and char *p =

"string"; ? 

1.34 How do I initialize a pointer to a function? 

_________________________________________________________________

2. Structures, Unions, and Enumerations

2.1 What's the difference between struct x1 { ... }; and typedef

struct { ... } x2; ? 

2.2 Why doesn't "struct x { ... }; x thestruct;" work? 

2.3 Can a structure contain a pointer to itself? 

2.4 What's the best way of implementing opaque (abstract) data types

in C? 

2.6 I came across some code that declared a structure with the last

member an array of one element, and then did some tricky allocation to

make it act like the array had several elements. Is this legal or

portable? 

2.7 I heard that structures could be assigned to variables and passed

to and from functions, but K&R1 says not. 

2.8 Why can't you compare structures? 

2.9 How are structure passing and returning implemented? 

2.10 Can I pass constant values to functions which accept structure

arguments? 

2.11 How can I read/write structures from/to data files? 

2.12 How can I turn off structure padding? 

2.13 Why does sizeof report a larger size than I expect for a

structure type? 

2.14 How can I determine the byte offset of a field within a

structure? 

2.15 How can I access structure fields by name at run time? 

2.18 I have a program which works correctly, but dumps core after it

finishes. Why? 

2.20 Can I initialize unions? 

2.22 What is the difference between an enumeration and a set of

preprocessor #defines? 

2.24 Is there an easy way to print enumeration values symbolically? 

_________________________________________________________________

3. Expressions

3.1 Why doesn't the code "a[i] = i++;" work? 

3.2 Under my compiler, the code "int i = 7; printf("%d\n", i++ *

i++);" prints 49. Regardless of the order of evaluation, shouldn't it

print 56? 

3.3 How could the code [CENSORED] ever give 7? 

3.4 Don't precedence and parentheses dictate order of evaluation? 

3.5 But what about the && and || operators? 

3.8 What's a ``sequence point''? 

3.9 So given "a[i] = i++;" we don't know which cell of a[] gets

written to, but i does get incremented by one. 

3.12 If I'm not using the value of the expression, should I use i++ or

++i to increment a variable? 

3.14 Why doesn't the code "int a = 1000, b = 1000; long int c = a *

b;" work? 

3.16 Can I use ?: on the left-hand side of an assignment expression? 

_________________________________________________________________

4. Pointers

4.2 What's wrong with "char *p; *p = malloc(10);"? 

4.3 Does *p++ increment p, or what it points to? 

4.5 I want to use a char * pointer to step over some ints. Why doesn't

"((int *)p)++;" work? 

4.8 I have a function which accepts, and is supposed to initialize, a

pointer, but the pointer in the caller remains unchanged. 

4.9 Can I use a void ** pointer to pass a generic pointer to a

function by reference? 

4.10 I have a function which accepts a pointer to an int. How can I

pass a constant like 5 to it? 

4.11 Does C even have ``pass by reference''? 

4.12 I've seen different methods used for calling functions via

pointers. 

_________________________________________________________________

5. Null Pointers

5.1 What is this infamous null pointer, anyway? 

5.2 How do I get a null pointer in my programs? 

5.3 Is the abbreviated pointer comparison ``if(p)'' to test for

non-null pointers valid? 

5.4 What is NULL and how is it #defined? 

5.5 How should NULL be defined on a machine which uses a nonzero bit

pattern as the internal representation of a null pointer? 

5.6 If NULL were defined as ``((char *)0),'' wouldn't that make

function calls which pass an uncast NULL work? 

5.9 If NULL and 0 are equivalent as null pointer constants, which

should I use? 

5.10 But wouldn't it be better to use NULL, in case the value of NULL

changes? 

5.12 I use the preprocessor macro "#define Nullptr(type) (type *)0" to

help me build null pointers of the correct type. 

5.13 This is strange. NULL is guaranteed to be 0, but the null pointer

is not? 

5.14 Why is there so much confusion surrounding null pointers? 

5.15 I'm confused. I just can't understand all this null pointer

stuff. 

5.16 Given all the confusion surrounding null pointers, wouldn't it be

easier simply to require them to be represented internally by zeroes? 

5.17 Seriously, have any actual machines really used nonzero null

pointers? 

5.20 What does a run-time ``null pointer assignment'' error mean? 

_________________________________________________________________

6. Arrays and Pointers

6.1 I had the definition char a[6] in one source file, and in another

I declared extern char *a. Why didn't it work? 

6.2 But I heard that char a[] was identical to char *a. 

6.3 So what is meant by the ``equivalence of pointers and arrays'' in

C? 

6.4 Why are array and pointer declarations interchangeable as function

formal parameters? 

6.7 How can an array be an lvalue, if you can't assign to it? 

6.8 What is the real difference between arrays and pointers? 

6.9 Someone explained to me that arrays were really just constant

pointers. 

6.11 I came across some ``joke'' code containing the ``expression''

5["abcdef"] . How can this be legal C? 

6.12 What's the difference between array and &array? 

6.13 How do I declare a pointer to an array? 

6.14 How can I set an array's size at compile time? 

6.15 How can I declare local arrays of a size matching a passed-in

array? 

6.16 How can I dynamically allocate a multidimensional array? 

6.17 Can I simulate a non-0-based array with a pointer? 

6.18 My compiler complained when I passed a two-dimensional array to a

function expecting a pointer to a pointer. 

6.19 How do I write functions which accept two-dimensional arrays when

the ``width'' is not known at compile time? 

6.20 How can I use statically- and dynamically-allocated

multidimensional arrays interchangeably when passing them to

functions? 

6.21 Why doesn't sizeof properly report the size of an array which is

a parameter to a function? 

_________________________________________________________________

7. Memory Allocation

7.1 Why doesn't the code ``char *answer; gets(answer);'' work? 

7.2 I can't get strcat to work. I tried ``char *s3 = strcat(s1, s2);''

but I got strange results. 

7.3 But the man page for strcat says that it takes two char *'s as

arguments. How am I supposed to know to allocate things? 

7.5 I have a function that is supposed to return a string, but when it

returns to its caller, the returned string is garbage. 

7.6 Why am I getting ``warning: assignment of pointer from integer

lacks a cast'' for calls to malloc? 

:wq

7.7 Why does some code carefully cast the values returned by malloc to

the pointer type being allocated? 

7.8 Why does so much code leave out the multiplication by sizeof(char)

when allocating strings? 

7.14 I've heard that some operating systems don't actually allocate

malloc'ed memory until the program tries to use it. Is this legal? 

7.16 I'm allocating a large array for some numeric work, but malloc is

acting strangely. 

7.17 I've got 8 meg of memory in my PC. Why can I only seem to malloc

640K or so? 

7.19 My program is crashing, apparently somewhere down inside malloc. 

7.20 You can't use dynamically-allocated memory after you free it, can

you? 

7.21 Why isn't a pointer null after calling free? 

7.22 When I call malloc to allocate memory for a local pointer, do I

have to explicitly free it? 

7.23 When I free a dynamically-allocated structure containing

pointers, do I have to free each subsidiary pointer first? 

7.24 Must I free allocated memory before the program exits? 

7.25 Why doesn't my program's memory usage go down when I free memory?

7.26 How does free know how many bytes to free? 

7.27 So can I query the malloc package to find out how big an

allocated block is? 

7.30 Is it legal to pass a null pointer as the first argument to

realloc? 

7.31 What's the difference between calloc and malloc? 

7.32 What is alloca and why is its use discouraged? 

_________________________________________________________________

8. Characters and Strings

8.1 Why doesn't "strcat(string, '!');" work? 

8.2 Why won't the test if(string == "value") correctly compare string

against the value? 

- 8.3 Why can't I assign strings to character arrays? 

8.6 How can I get the numeric (character set) value corresponding to a

character? 

8.9 Why is sizeof('a') not 1? 

_________________________________________________________________

9. Boolean Expressions and Variables

9.1 What is the right type to use for Boolean values in C? 

9.2 What if a built-in logical or relational operator ``returns''

something other than 1? 

9.3 Is if(p), where p is a pointer, valid? 

_________________________________________________________________

10. C Preprocessor

10.2 I've got some cute preprocessor macros that let me write C code

that looks more like Pascal. What do y'all think? 

10.3 How can I write a generic macro to swap two values? 

10.4 What's the best way to write a multi-statement macro? 

10.6 What are .h files and what should I put in them? 

10.7 Is it acceptable for one header file to #include another? 

10.8 Where are header (``#include'') files searched for? 

10.9 I'm getting strange syntax errors on the very first declaration

in a file, but it looks fine. 

10.11 Where can I get a copy of a missing header file? 

10.12 How can I construct preprocessor #if expressions which compare

strings? 

10.13 Does the sizeof operator work in preprocessor #if directives? 

10.14 Can I use an #ifdef in a #define line, to define something two

different ways? 

10.15 Is there anything like an #ifdef for typedefs? 

10.16 How can I use a preprocessor #if expression to detect

endianness? 

10.18 How can I preprocess some code to remove selected conditional

compilations, without preprocessing everything? 

10.19 How can I list all of the pre#defined identifiers? 

10.20 I have some old code that tries to construct identifiers with a

macro like "#define Paste(a, b) a/**/b", but it doesn't work any more.

10.22

What does the message ``warning: macro replacement within a string

literal'' mean?

10.23 How can I use a macro argument inside a string literal in the

macro expansion? 

10.25 I've got this tricky preprocessing I want to do and I can't

figure out a way to do it. 

10.26 How can I write a macro which takes a variable number of

arguments? 

_________________________________________________________________

11. ANSI/ISO Standard C

11.1 What is the ``ANSI C Standard?'' 

11.2 How can I get a copy of the Standard? 

11.3 My ANSI compiler is complaining about prototype mismatches for

parameters declared float. 

11.4 Can you mix old-style and new-style function syntax? 

11.5 Why does the declaration "extern f(struct x *p);" give me a

warning message? 

11.8 Why can't I use const values in initializers and array

dimensions? 

11.9 What's the difference between const char *p and char * const p? 

11.10 Why can't I pass a char ** to a function which expects a const

char **? 

11.12 Can I declare main as void, to shut off these annoying ``main

returns no value'' messages? 

11.13 But what about main's third argument, envp? 

11.14 I believe that declaring void main() can't fail, since I'm

calling exit instead of returning. 

11.15 The book I've been using always uses void main(). 

11.16 Is exit(status) truly equivalent to returning the same status

from main? 

11.17 How do I get the ANSI ``stringizing'' preprocessing operator `#'

to stringize the macro's value instead of its name? 

11.18 What does the message ``warning: macro replacement within a

string literal'' mean? 

11.19 I'm getting strange syntax errors inside lines I've #ifdeffed

out. 

11.20 What are #pragmas ? 

-- pre 11.21 What does ``#pragma once'' mean? 

11.22 Is char a[3] = "abc"; legal? 

11.24 Why can't I perform arithmetic on a void * pointer? 

11.25 What's the difference between memcpy and memmove? 

11.26 What should malloc(0) do? 

11.27 Why does the ANSI Standard not guarantee more than six

case-insensitive characters of external identifier significance? 

11.29 My compiler is rejecting the simplest possible test programs,

with all kinds of syntax errors. 

11.30 Why are some ANSI/ISO Standard library routines showing up as

undefined, even though I've got an ANSI compiler? 

11.31 Does anyone have a tool for converting old-style C programs to

ANSI C, or for automatically generating prototypes? 

11.32 Why won't frobozz-cc, which claims to be ANSI compliant, accept

this code? 

11.33 What's the difference between implementation-defined,

unspecified, and undefined behavior? 

11.34 I'm appalled that the ANSI Standard leaves so many issues

undefined. 

11.35 I just tried some allegedly-undefined code on an ANSI-conforming

compiler, and got the results I expected. 

_________________________________________________________________

12. Stdio

12.1 What's wrong with the code "char c; while((c = getchar()) != EOF)

..."? 

12.2 Why won't the code `` while(!feof(infp)) { fgets(buf, MAXLINE,

infp); fputs(buf, outfp); } '' work? 

12.4 My program's prompts and intermediate output don't always show up

on the screen.

12.10 How can I implement a variable field width with printf? 

12.11 How can I print numbers with commas separating the thousands? 

12.12 Why doesn't the call scanf("%d", i) work? 

-- 12.13 Why doesn't the code "double d; scanf("%f", &d);" work? 

12.15 How can I specify a variable width in a scanf format string? 

12.17 When I read numbers from the keyboard with scanf "%d\n", it

seems to hang until I type one extra line of input. 

12.18 I'm reading a number with scanf %d and then a string with

gets(), but the compiler seems to be skipping the call to gets()! 

12.19 I'm re-prompting the user if scanf fails, but sometimes it seems

to go into an infinite loop. 

12.20 Why does everyone say not to use scanf? What should I use

instead? 

12.21 How can I tell how much destination buffer space I'll need for

an arbitrary sprintf call? How can I avoid overflowing the destination

buffer with sprintf? 

12.23 Why does everyone say not to use gets()? 

12.24 Why does errno contain ENOTTY after a call to printf? 

12.25 What's the difference between fgetpos/fsetpos and ftell/fseek? 

12.26 Will fflush(stdin) flush unread characters from the standard

input stream? 

12.30 I'm trying to update a file in place, by using fopen mode "r+",

but it's not working. 

12.33 How can I redirect stdin or stdout from within a program? 

12.34 Once I've used freopen, how can I get the original stream back?

13.7 I need some code to do regular expression and wildcard matching. 

13.8 I'm trying to sort an array of strings with qsort, using strcmp

as the comparison function, but it's not working. 

13.9 Now I'm trying to sort an array of structures, but the compiler

is complaining that the function is of the wrong type for qsort. 

13.10 How can I sort a linked list? 

13.11 How can I sort more data than will fit in memory? 

13.12 How can I get the time of day in a C program? 

13.13 How can I convert a struct tm or a string into a time_t? 

13.14 How can I perform calendar manipulations? 

13.15 I need a random number generator. 

13.16 How can I get random integers in a certain range? 

13.17 Each time I run my program, I get the same sequence of numbers

back from rand(). 

13.18 I need a random true/false value, so I'm just taking rand() % 2,

but it's alternating 0, 1, 0, 1, 0... 

13.20 How can I generate random numbers with a normal or Gaussian

distribution? 

13.24 I'm trying to port this old program. Why do I get ``undefined

external'' errors for some library functions? 

13.25 I get errors due to library functions being undefined even

though I #include the right header files. 

13.26 I'm still getting errors due to library functions being

undefined, even though I'm requesting the right libraries. 

13.28 What does it mean when the linker says that _end is undefined? 

_________________________________________________________________

14. Floating Point

equality? 

14.6 How do I round numbers? 

14.7 Where is C's exponentiation operator?

14.11 What's a good way to implement complex numbers in C? 

14.12 I'm looking for some mathematical library code. 

14.13 I'm having trouble with a Turbo C program which crashes and says

something like ``floating point formats not linked.'' 

_________________________________________________________________

15. Variable-Length Argument Lists

15.1 I heard that you have to #include <stdio.h> before calling

printf. Why? 

15.2 How can %f be used for both float and double arguments in printf?

15.3 Why don't function prototypes guard against mismatches in

printf's arguments? 

15.4 How can I write a function that takes a variable number of

called with? 

15.9 My compiler isn't letting me declare a function that accepts only

variable arguments.

pointer-to-function. 

15.12 How can I write a function which takes a variable number of

arguments and passes them to some other function ? 

15.13 How can I call a function with an argument list built up at run

time? 

_________________________________________________________________

16.4 I have a program that seems to run correctly, but then crashes as

it's exiting. 

16.5 This program runs perfectly on one machine, but I get weird

results on another. 

16.6 Why does the code "char *p = "hello, world!"; p[0] = 'H';" crash?

16.8 What does ``Segmentation violation'' mean? 

_________________________________________________________________

17. Style

17.1 What's the best style for code layout in C? 

17.3 Is the code "if(!strcmp(s1, s2))" good style? 

17.4 Why do some people write if(0 == x) instead of if(x == 0)? 

17.5 I came across some code that puts a (void) cast before each call

to printf. Why? 

17.8 What is Hungarian Notation''? Is it worthwhile? 

17.9 Where can I get the ``Indian Hill Style Guide'' and other coding

standards? 

17.10 Some people say that goto's are evil and that I should never use

them. Isn't that a bit extreme? 

_________________________________________________________________

code beautifiers, etc.). 

18.2 How can I track down these pesky malloc problems? 

18.3 What's a free or cheap C compiler I can use? 

18.4 I just typed in this program, and it's acting strangely. Can you
