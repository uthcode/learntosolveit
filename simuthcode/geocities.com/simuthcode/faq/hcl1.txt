Murthy from each section I am giving one are to quetions also because for
checking whether the same paper or not.
    And for doubtful answers also I am writing quetions but not writing answers
for these quetions.
Section-I1). Piggy backing is a technique for

12) b           has to be unique in the sub network
13)Q. there is an employer table with key feilds as employer no. data in every
 n'th row are needed for a simple following queries will get required results.
  a) select A employe no. from employe A , where exists from employe B
where A employe no. >= B employe having (count(*) mod n)=0
  b) select employe no. from employe A, employe B where
A employe no. >= B employ no.   grouply employe no. having (count(*) mod n=0 )
  c) both a& b  d)none of the above
14)Q. type duplicates of a row in a table customer with non uniform key feild
customer no. you can seea) delete from costomer where customer no. exists
( select distinct customer no. from customer having count )
b) delete customer a  where customer no. in
(select customer  b where custermer no. equal to b custemor no. ) and a rowid >
b rowidc) delete customer a where custermor no. in
( select customer no. from customer a, customer b )d) none of the above
15)  c          Volatile modifier

                                                SECTION-II
Section II is not covered completly But it is very very easy. You can do it
 very easely.1)   ans: recursion 2) long int size

ans: compiler dependentnote: order of a,b,c,d are doubt but answer is correct.
3) x=2,y=6,z=6x=y==z;printf(%d",x)    ?4) if(x>2)?3:4  5)6)
7)  ans: c  6  ( quetion on enum )8) ------------
14)  c : class A,B and C can have member  functions with same name.

          BEST OF LUCK
 In written test in each section you have to get minimum marks i.e
you have to pass in each section.  There will be questions from C,
C++, JAVA. about 10 questions in C++ in the written test.
