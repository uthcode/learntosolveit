4. Temperature and pressure problem

     Some combination of products are made to set final product.


     a) If the product (final ) is perfect then measure temperature 
     pressure and do some calculation
     b) If the combination is not good, then change the combination
     and verify whether new one is perfect.
     c)Eventhough the combination is good, pressure and temperature
     may vary so monitor them constantly.  If any of this varies then
     reset them and set the starting for new combination

     1) Is pressure constant
     2) Is temperature constant
     3) Is the final product perfect

5) Find largest of smallest in 50 numbers
   Find position of largest and smallest

   Largest stored in LARGEST
   smallest stored in SMALLEST
   Largest one position in LNUM
   Smallest one position in SNUM
Ans:

1. X(count)<SMALLEST
2. Store count in SNUM
3. Store X(count) in LARGEST 
4. Is count>50




      FLOW CHARTS
      -----------
it is not possible to type but answers are corrct.
1)nine balls are grouped into three groups with three balls each
0ne ball is heavier than all other balls find the ball which is heaviest with the help of following flow chart fill the gapsin the flow chart.

cell(1):1.is A heavier than B ? 2. is B heavier than A?
3)do balls 1 &2 weigh the same ? 4)do A &B weigh the same ?
5) is group C is the heaviest ?

cell (2):1)do balls 1&2 weigh the same ? 2)do balls 1 &2 weigh less than ball 3? 3)do balls 1 &3 weigh the same? 4)is ball 1 heavier than ball 2?
5)is ball 2 heavier than ball 1?

cell (3): 1)is ball 1 heavier than ball 3 ? 2)is ball 3 the heaviest?
3)is ball 1 is heavier than ball 2 ? 4)do balls 1 &2 weigh the same ?
5)do balls 1&3 weigh the same?

cell (4):1)continue testing with group A? 2)continue testing with group C? 3)continue testing with group B? 4)number the balls in the test as 1,2,3 ?
5)A is heavier than B ?

cell (5):1)continue testing with group A? 2)A is heavier than B?
3)continue testing with group B ? 4)number the balls 1,2,3? 
5)B is heavier than A?

answers:
cell(1)==4 ;; cell(2)==1 ;; cell(3)==3;;cell(4)==1;;cell(5)==3.


flow chart problem 2:
--------------------
problem and conditions:

A. Ajar contains red and black numbered balls
B.to win you must advance by 7 times.
C. you can advance by drawing: 1)an even numbered black ball
2)an odd numbered red ball 3)an even numbered red ballif preceding ball was an oddnumbered red ball 4)an od numbered black ball if preceding ball was an even numbered black ball.

cell(1):1)was the preceding ball was red? 2)was the preceding ball black? 3)is it an odd number ? 4)is it an even number ? 5)is it black?

cell(2):1)was it an even number? 2)was it black? 3)do you win?4)do you advance?5)was it an odd number?
cell(3):1)is the advance count 7? 2)is it black? 3)is it an even number?  4)is it an odd number?  5)was the preceding ball red?

cell(4):1)what is advance count? 2)was the preceding ball red?3)was it an odd number?  4)do you lose? 5)was it an even number?

cell(5):1)is the advance count 7? 2)is it an even number?  3)was it an odd number?  4)is it red?  5)is it black?

answers:

cell(1):==3;; cell(2)==1;; cell(3) ==3;; cell(4)==3;; cell(5)==1;;
