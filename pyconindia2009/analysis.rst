Asymptote \As"ymp*tote\ (?; 215), n.
====================================
  
     A line which approaches nearer to some curve than assignable
     distance, but, though infinitely extended, would never meet
     it. Asymptotes may be straight lines or curves. A rectilinear
     asymptote may be conceived as a tangent to the curve at an
     infinite distance.
