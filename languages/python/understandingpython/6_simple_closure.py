"""
A Simple Example of closure in python
A closure is function which returns another function. For example, the
``constant`` function here returns, ``_inner`` function. At the top level you
passed the value and calling the inner function from within, it is not required
to send the value.

def constant(value):
    def _inner():
        return value
    return _inner
x = constant(5)
print(x())
