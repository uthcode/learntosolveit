# links is a list of Link objects. Links have a handful of properties. For
# example, a Link's number of votes can be accessed by link.votes if "link" is a
# Link.

# make and populate a table
db = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
db.execute('create table links ' +
          '(id integer, submitter_id integer, submitted_time integer, ' +
          'votes integer, title text, url text)')
for l in links:
    db.execute('insert into links values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)', l)

# db is an in-memory sqlite database that can respond to sql queries using the
# execute() function.
#
# For example. If you run
#
# c = db.execute("select * from links")
#
# c will be a "cursor" to the results of that query. You can use the fetchmany()
# function on the cursor to convert that cursor into a list of results. These
# results won't be Links; they'll be tuples, but they can be passed turned into
# a Link.
#
# For example, to print all the votes for all of the links, do this:
#
# c = db.execute("select * from links")
# for link_tuple in c:
#     link = Link(*link_tuple)
#     print link.votes
#
# QUIZ - make the function query() return the number of votes the link with ID = 2 has
def query():
